## 🚀 What is Vault Shield?

Vault Shield revolutionizes NFT lending by implementing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to protect your digital assets' true value. Unlike traditional platforms that expose collateral values, we ensure complete privacy while maintaining competitive lending rates.

### 🎯 Core Innovation

- **🔒 Zero-Knowledge Collateralization**: Your NFT values remain encrypted throughout the entire lending process
- **⚡ Instant Liquidity**: Access funds against your NFTs without market impact
- **🛡️ Anti-Manipulation**: Prevent price manipulation through confidential lending
- **🌐 Multi-Chain Ready**: Built for the future of cross-chain DeFi

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **FHE Encryption** | All financial data encrypted on-chain | Complete privacy protection |
| **Smart Liquidation** | Automated risk management | Reduced liquidation risk |
| **Reputation System** | Encrypted credit scoring | Better rates for good borrowers |
| **Multi-Wallet** | Support for all major wallets | Seamless user experience |
